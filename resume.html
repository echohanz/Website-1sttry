		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<div class ="Projects">
			<h3>07/2019 - 08/2019____Scheme Compiler____Programmer</h3>
			<p>Designed a compiler that worked as a translator for two programming languages.
			<br/>
			Implemented functions that take inputs and identify which languages they currently are.
			<br/>
			Implemented functions that translate inputs into demanded languages and complete the instruction using
			the demanded languages.
			<br/>
			Achieved the goal of translating scheme language to python language and back from python to scheme.			</p>
			<br/>
			<h3>01/2020 - 03/2020____Othello AI____Programmer</h3>
			<p>
				<br/>
				Created an AI program for the game Othello which helped the program to decide which move to make whe
				n playing against another player. The game ends when every cell in the grid contains a tile, or when neithe
				r player is able to make a legal move
				<br/>
				Built within the environment of C++, using recursion and search trees.
				<br/>
				Achieved the goal that our AI program wins every time no matter we are holding black tile or white tile, and
				no matter we go first or later.
