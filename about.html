			<h1>About Myself</h1>
			<div class ="cd">
			<p>I am Luhan Zhao from
			<a href ="https://uci.edu/" rel="UCI">UCI</a>.
			I am a junior student major in Computer Science, with a
			specialization of information. 
			<br/>
			I come from Chengdu, China, which is also known as the home of 
			pandas. If you are interested in great food around the world, then
			you must know this place with its most famous hotpot.

			<h1>Experience</h1>
			<div class = "ex">
			<p>
				I was grown up in China, and for some personal reasons,
				I went to the United of States in the age of 16. The school
				I went to was Xavier High School in Wisconsin, hopefully 
				some of you could recognize it and I graduated in the year
				of 2018.
				<br/>
				The city I lived in China never snows, so I was excited
				when arriving in Wisconsin for the first time. But later on,
				the cold weather taught me a really serious lesson. And then,
				I came to California.
				<br/>
				I was not coming in UCI with the major of Computer Science,
				however, since the great interest I had in my mind, after the first
				year of study, I successfully transferred into ICS department.
				To me, coding is suffering, but the most magical thing is the 
				sense of achievement after your program works. 
				<br/>
				Computer Science is an amazing object, all the aspects of it
				worth discovering, and I believe in the future I will continue
				my study with computer science, and one day, make something great
				enough to brag for life.
